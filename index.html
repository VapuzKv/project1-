        <p class="desc">Philip Emeagwali is a Nigerian <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_scientist" target="_blank">computer scientist</a> . He
            has been living in the United States for many years.[1] He won the
            1989 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_Bell_Prize" target="_blank">Gordon Bell Prize</a> ($1,000) for price-performance in high-performance computing
            applications, in an oil reservoir
            modeling calculation using a novel mathematical formulation and implementation.[2][3]

        <h2 class="subtitle"><a name="biography"></a>Biography</h2>
        <p class="text">Emeagwali was born in Akure, Nigeria on 23 August 1954.[4] His early schooling was suspended in
            1967 as a result of the
            Nigerian Civil War. At 13 years, he served in the Biafran army. After the war he completed high-school
            equivalence
            through self-study. He is married to Dale Brown Emeagwali, a noted African-American microbiologist.[5]

        <h2 class="subtitle"><a name="education"></a>Education &#128218;</h2>
        <p class="txt">He traveled to the United States to study under a scholarship following completion of a
            correspondence course at the
            University of London. He received a bachelor's degree in mathematics from Oregon State University in 1977.
            He later
            moved to Washington DC, receiving in 1986 a master's degree from George Washington University in ocean and
            marine
            engineering, and a second master's in applied mathematics from the University of Maryland. Next magazine
            suggested that
            Emeagwali claimed to have further degrees.[6][7] During this time, he worked as a civil engineer at the
            Bureau of Land
            Reclamation in Wyoming.

        <h3 class="subject"><a name="case"></a>Court case and the denial of degree
        </h3>

        <p class="text">Emeagwali studied for a Ph.D. degree from the University of Michigan from 1987 through 1991. His
            thesis was not accepted
            by a committee of internal and external examiners and thus he was not awarded the degree. Emeagwali filed a
            court
            challenge, stating that the decision was a violation of his civil rights and that the university had
            discriminated
            against him in several ways because of his race. The court challenge was dismissed, as was an appeal to the
            Michigan
            state Court of Appeals.[8]

        </h2>
        <p class="txt">Emeagwali received the 1989 Gordon Bell Prize for an application of the CM-2 massively-parallel
            computer. The
            application used computational fluid dynamics for oil-reservoir modeling. He received a prize in
            "price/performance"
            category, with a performance figure of about 400 Mflops/$1M.[15] The winner in the "performance" category,
            was also the
            winner of the Price/performance category, but unable to receive two prizes. Mobil Research and Thinking
            Machines, used
            the CM-2 for seismic data processing and achieved the higher ratio of 500 Mflops/$1M. The judges decided on
            one award
            per entry.[3][2] His method involved each microprocessor communicating with six neighbors.[10]

        <p class="desc">Emeagwali's simulation was the first program to apply a pseudo-time approach to reservoir
            modeling.[1]
